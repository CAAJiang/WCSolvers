# WCSolvers
Weakly compressible solvers for OpenFOAM v2112

apac is the solver used in the paper 
"An acoustic-wave preserved artificial compressibility method for low-Mach-number aeroacoustic simulations" by Jiang and Zhang, Journal of Sound and Vibration, 2022

wcAero is an correction of apac by removing an unnecessary term $$p\nabla \cdot \symbfit{u}$$
